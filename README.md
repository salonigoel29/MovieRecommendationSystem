# MovieRecommendationSystem
What can we say about the success of a movie before it is released? Are there certain companies (Pixar?) that have found a consistent formula? Given that major films costing over $100 million to produce can still flop, this question is more important than ever to the industry. Film aficionados might have different interests. Can we predict which films will be highly rated, whether or not they are a commercial success?
These are the questions that inspired us to take these datasets up, combine them and perform our analysis.


In this project, we have used 2 data sources that are **TMDB 5000 movies dataset** and **Movies Credits dataset**.

<br> <font>*Movies Credits dataset:* https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_credits.csv 

In this project, we imported and analysed two dataset and then communicated the findings about it. We used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

This data set contains information movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.

We will explore the following questions:
1. Finding the top 10 popular movies
2. Relationship of Revenue with budget
3. Distribution of all the columns in the dataset
4. Analysis of runtime of movies
5. Finding the most profitable movie

Apart from EDA, we have also created a movie recommendation system.
